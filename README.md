# Thesis

Here you can see the template for my report:
https://www.overleaf.com/3527757152mbftgjycgpkm

In:
/object_relation_transformer/scripts/
...you can find variants for the original scripts for working with 3D data. Some of the other scripts have been modified too to work with our new data. 

Also, the file in /object_relation_transformer/data/dataset_coco.json has a variant /object_relation_transformer/data/dataset_annotations_1_long_sentence.json, which is basically the version designed for the sentences3d dataset. 
(I should probably fix this to something not called 'coco', not sure what I was thinking here. )
